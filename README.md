# BetYourLife

Game created on Ludum Dare 44
We decided to make a russian roulette kind of party game as the subject of this event is “Your life is currency”. 
The game will be launched on android devices (with +5.0 android). PC version will be android port. 
Each player (from 2 to 8) gets his own revolver and uses it to bet his life. The one who stays alive and is the richest one is the winner.
It is your life, that you use as money and well… life!
We created all the graphics including 2d art and 3d models. For music and sound effects, we used gamesounds.xyz
